I've uploaded some text for the report. That's all I can do for you. I'm sorry.

Cliche as it sounds I have suffered a pretty significant mental breakdown this week due to a number of factors. I spent eight hours of yesterday staring at a ceiling thinking about this project. I have not scored above a 70% on anything in CSC111 and I have not contributed anything to this group. I have found myself unable to study or work on assignments or anything. Right now I am not capable of succeeding in computer science and I am clearly not capable of working in a group.

I'm sure you're absolutely pissed off at me seeing as I've not communicated with any of you for about 60 hours. If there is any sort of peer evaluation for this project I will be scoring myself low and I encourage you to do the same. I also want to let you know, not that it's going to fix anything, that I have genuinely never felt like more of a scumbag about anything in my entire life. I really wish I could have done more, but it is currently beyond my mental and technical capability. Sorry.
