    abstract="This chapter examines the key features of the crime decline in the United States during the 1990s--2010s but also takes a broader look at the violence declines globally. The author argues that violent and property crime trends might have diverged recently, with property crimes increasingly happening in the online sphere. An important distinction is made between `contact crimes' that require a victim and offender to be present in the same physical space, and other crimes. Contrary to the uncertainties engendered by property crime, the declines in violent (contact) crime are rather general, and have been happening across all demographic and geographic categories within the United States and throughout the developed world. An analysis of research literature on crime trends has identified 24 different explanations for the crime drop. Each one of them is briefly outlined and examined in terms of conceptual clarity and empirical support, with 9 crime decline explanations highlighted as promising. Most of these promising explanations, being relative newcomers in the crime trends literature, have not been sufficiently empirically tested and thus require further research. One potentially fruitful avenue for future studies is to examine the association of the most promising crime decline explanations with improvements in self-control.",

    title = {{The Influence of Gun Availability on Violent Crime Patterns}},
    issn = {01923234},
    url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1147506},
    abstract = {The spectacular increases in violent crime that began in the mid-1960s continue, and Americans are currently being murdered, robbed, and raped at historically unprecedented rates. Firearms are used in a minority of violent crimes but are of special concern because more than 60 percent of the most serious crimes-criminal homicides-are committed with firearms. This essay presents a variety of evidence to the effect that the widespread availability of firearms contributes to the criminal homicide rate and influences violent crime patterns in several other respects as well. A gun is usually superior to other weapons readily available for use in violent crime; even in the hands of a weak and unskilled assailant, a gun poses a credible threat and can be used to kill quickly, from a distance, and in a relatively "impersonal" fashion. Guns are particularly valuable against relatively invulnerable targets. Hence, gun availability facilitates robbery of commercial places and lethal assaults on people who would ordinarily be able to defend themselves against other weapons. Some of the patterns of gun use in violent crime can be readily interpreted in terms of relative vulnerability of different types of victims. Guns are also more dangerous than other weapons, in the sense that victims of robbery and assault are more likely to be killed if the assailant uses a gun. On the other hand, the victim is less likely to be injured in a gun robbery than in other robberies, since the gun robber usually does not feel the need to employ physical force. This analysis suggests a number of predictions concerning the effects of gun availability on the number, distribution, and seriousness of violent crimes. In principle, these predictions could be tested directly by observing the effects of changes in gun availability on statistical characterizations of violent crime patterns. Not much research of this sort has been done, in part because it is difficult to find a suitable measure for gun availability. Future research should be directed toward remedying this problem. In the meantime, it seems fair to conclude from the available evidence that the type of weapon is not an incidental aspect of violent crime, but rather has a substantial influence on the nature of the encounter and its likely consequences.},

    abstract = {Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions. To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories.This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13 812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths.Firearm ownership and access.Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year.Worldwide, it was estimated that 251 000 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 195 000-276 000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5\% (95\% UI, 42.2\%-54.8\%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209 000 (95\% UI, 172 000 to 235 000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0\% [95\% UI, 54.2\%-68.0\%]; absolute value, 161 000 deaths [95\% UI, 107 000-182 000]); additionally, 27\% were firearm suicide deaths (67 500 [95\% UI, 55 400-84 100]) and 9\% were unintentional firearm deaths (23 000 [95\% UI, 18 200-24 800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (−0.2\% [95\% UI, −0.8\% to 0.2\%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6\% (95\% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9\% (95\% UI, 0.5\%-1.3\%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34 700 deaths [95\% UI, 24 900-39 700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95\% UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P \&lt; .001; R2 = 0.21) and homicide (P \&lt; .001; R2 = 0.35).This study estimated between 195 000 and 276 000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups.}

    abstract = {{Firearms account for a substantial proportion of external causes of death, injury, and disability across the world. Legislation to regulate firearms has often been passed with the intent of reducing problems related to their use. However, lack of clarity around which interventions are effective remains a major challenge for policy development. Aiming to meet this challenge, we systematically reviewed studies exploring the associations between firearm-related laws and firearm homicides, suicides, and unintentional injuries/deaths. We restricted our search to studies published from 1950 to 2014. Evidence from 130 studies in 10 countries suggests that in certain nations the simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths. Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g., background checks) and access to (e.g., safer storage) firearms are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, respectively. Limitations of studies include challenges inherent to their ecological design, their execution, and the lack of robustness of findings to model specifications. High quality research on the association between the implementation or repeal of firearm legislation (rather than the evaluation of existing laws) and firearm injuries would lead to a better understanding of what interventions are likely to work given local contexts. This information is key to move this field forward and for the development of effective policies that may counteract the burden that firearm injuries pose on populations.}},

We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80\%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates.
