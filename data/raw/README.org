#+TITLE: Read Me

This is where we will put the raw data for the wiki project. The only problem is that the files are too large to push to github so I'm going to add a line in the gitignore here, and all of us (space permitting) will put the file in the correct place so that all the code will still run... I'll add the gitignore once we figure out which file we're going to be using and what it's name is.
